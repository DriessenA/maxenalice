![Slot Assumburg](images/kasteel_small.jpg)

The wedding is held on July 4th 2025 in the youth hostel [Stayokay Slot Assumburg](https://www.stayokay.com/en/hostel/heemskerk).
The address is Tolweg 9, 1967 NG Heemskerk, the Netherlands.
Details on how to reach the venue can be found on the website of the location.

## Schedule
This is the program of the wedding day. Please be aware that due to location capacity we were not able to invite all guests for all program items.
Since there is only limited capacity for the dinner, it's possible that you've received an invitation to both the reception and the party, but not to the dinner.
In that case - if you'd like to attend both events - you could go for dinner in [one of the nearby restaurants](https://www.google.com/maps/search/Restaurants/@52.5087696,4.6730517,15z/data=!4m7!2m6!3m5!2sStayokay+Hostel+Heemskerk+(Slot+Assumburg)!3s0x47c5fa0b7735a4f3:0x247bb53488a5bbe2!4m2!1d4.6850683!2d52.5052176?hl=en-US&entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MDUxNS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D).

We plan to have breakfast around 8:45 in case you are interested in sharing our first morning as a married couple.

## Sleeping arrangements
For the guest who are joining the party it is possible to spend the night in the hostel! 
We have reserved 50 beds (incl. breakfast) in the Stayokay, where you can spend the night for free.
If you are interested to stay the night please reach out to us on: `bruiloftmalice@gmail.com`.
We will come back to you if there are still beds available. 

*NB: since it is a hostel, rooms are shared (2, 4 or 6 ppl per room).*
*Breakfast and bedsheets are included but towels are not, you can bring your own or rent one directly at the Stayokay.*
*If you prefer a private room and would like to stay the night, you can contact the Stayokay directly and reserve a private room at your own cost.* 

## Dresscode
There is no strict dresscode for our wedding, so feel free to wear what feels good for you!

## Gifts
We are very happy with a financial contribution towards our honeymoon.
